### How packets work
From my understanding, all packets are 20 bytes long.
The first byte is a identifier, followed by 18 bytes of data, followed by an XOR
 of ALL the bytes.
0x33 seems to be a command indicator (the only alternatives value for the first
  byte is 0xaa, 0xa1)

```regex
0x33: Indicator
0xaa: keep alive
0xa1: DIY VALUES
```

The second byte seems identify the packet type
```regex
    0x01: Power
    0x04: Brightness
    0x05: Color
```
The third byte differs based on type.

For power packets, it's a boolean indicating the power state. (0x00, or 0x01)
For brightness packets, it corresponds to a uint8 brightness value, affecting
 lights at about 0x14 to 1% - 0xfe to 100%
For color packets, this indicates an operation mode.

```regex
    0x33: Indicator
        0x01: Power
            0x00: Off
            0x01: On
        0x04: Brightness
            0x00: 0% (also Off)
            0x14: 1%
            0xfe: 100%
        0x05: Color
            0x02: Manual
            0x01: Music
            0x04: Scene
            0x0a: DIY
```

Color packets also carry an RGB value, followed by a boolean and a second RGB
 value. The boolean seems to switch the set of LEDs used within the bulb.

```regex
Have not verified this in the H6127 but the condition appears to exist. (from h6113)
There is one set for RGB values and one for warm/cold-white values, where True corresponds to the warm/cold-white LEDs. When the flag is set, the first RGB value seems to be ignored and vice-versa. The values for warm/cold-white LEDs cannot be set arbitrarily. The slider within the app UI uses a list of hardcoded color codes. (thanks Henje!)
```

Zeropadding follows. unless colors can be changed within mode.
Finally, a checksum over the payload is calculated by XORing all bytes.

```regex   
     0x33: Indicator
        0x01: power
            0x00: Off
            0x01: On
        0x04: brightness
            0x00: 0% (also Off)
            0x14: 1%
            0xfe: 100%
        0x05: color
            0x02: Manual
                0x000000: red, green, blue
                0xffffff: red, green, blue

```

### DIY
DIY mode appears to start with a keep alive followed by a start data packet,
 followed by 1 to 3 packets of data, followed by an end data packet, followed
 by the DIY mode command.

The Start Packet consists of 0xa102, PACKET#(0x00), TOTAL PACKET#'S, PADDING,
 XOR

```regex
    a102 00 02 000000000000000000000000000000a1 = Start
```

First 2 bytes are a1 and 02 sigaling a write

```regex
   0xa102: Write Data
```

Third byte is the Number of the packet from 00-ff

```regex    
    0x00: Start
    0x01: Number of packet
    0x02: Number of packet
    0x03: Number of packet
    0xff: End
```

Fourth byte is the name of the DIY in the App

```regex
    3b: Name
```

Fifth and Sixth bytes are the Style and the Style Mode

```regex
    00:Fade               01:Jumping              02:Flicker             03:Marquee           04:Music           FF:combo
        00:Whole              00:whole                00:Whole               03:Straight          08:Rhythm          00:??
        01: N/A               01:subsection           01:subsection          04:Gathered          06:Spectrum
        02:Circulation        02:circulation          02:Circulation         05:Dispersive        07:Rolling
```

Seventh byte is the Speed of transitions 00 being no movement, and 64 appearing
 to be the fastest

```regex
    00: No movement
    64: Fastest movement
```

Eighth byte is unknown at this time:

```regex
    18: PADDING?
```

Remaining bytes are the Colors limited to 8 colors total between (2 packets)

```regex    
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0xFFFFXX: Red, Green, XOR
```

Last byte is the XOR as shown above:

```regex
    XX: XOR
```

```regex
0xa102, PACKET#, NAME, STYLE, MODE, SPEED, ??, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, XOR
a102 01 0a 03 03 2b 18 ff0000 ff7f00 ffff00 00ff 1b
```

****The Second packet is mostly only color data and is only necessary if there
 are more than 2 colors in the DIY:****

First 2 bytes of 2nd Packet a102

```regex
    0xa102: Write Data
```

Third bytes of 2nd Packet is the packet number

```regex
    0x02: Packet number
```

Fourth byte of 2nd Packet is the Blue color data of the previous packet (if
 more than 2 colors)

```regex
    0xFF: Blue
```

Remaining packets are color packets, adding and XOR

```regex
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0xFFFFFF: Red, Green, Blue
    0x000000XX: Padding and XOR
```

```regex
0xa102, PACKET#, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, XOR
a102 02 00 0000ff 00ffff 8b00ff ffffff 000000d5 = Data
```

****Third Packet Appears to be for Combo Style and Style mode data****

```regex
    a102 03 0100 0200 0303 00000000000000000000a3
```

End Packet appears to be 0xa102, 0xff, Padding, XOR

```regex
a102 ff 000000000000000000000000000000005c = End
```

#### DIY Mode command
```regex
    33050a000000000000000000000000000000003c
```

## Reading current values

**seems to be broadcast by Govee device when you initially connect to it, WIP**

There has to be a way to read current status. So far I've discovered this.
For brightness, it's aa04......... etc. :
```regex
On notification handle (0x0011):
aa04fe0000000000000000000000000000000050 seems to mean that brightness is 100%
aa041400000000000000000000000000000000ba seems to mean that brightness is 1%

It seems like those values are spat out by the bluetooth controller if you write this to the same handle as usual 0x0015:
aa040000000000000000000000000000000000ae
```
For colour, it's aa05......... etc:
```regex
On notification handle (0x0011):
aa050dff0000000000000000000000000000005d seems to mean that colour is 100% red (I have not tested other colours at this time)
We should be able to assume then that aa05 means colour, 0d = ?? (colour state??) and FF, 00 ,00 is the current colour)

It seems like those values are spat out by the bluetooth controller if you write this to the same handle as usual 0x0015:
aa050100000000000000000000000000000000ae
```
